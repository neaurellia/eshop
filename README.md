Reflection 1

Here, my code follows the clean code principals taught in class to improve readability, maintainability and efficiency.

1. Meaningful naming 
- class names (ProductController, ProductServiceImpl, etc.) follow standard naming conventions and describe roles clearly
- method names (findAll(), createProduct(), etc.) reflect functionality accurately.
2. Functions and modularity: code has clear separation 
- Controller handles user requests.
- Service processes business logic.
- Repository manages data storage.
3. Objects and data structures
- Product is structured properly using private fields with getter and setter methods, ensuring encapsulation.
- The List<Product> collection in ProductRepository allows dynamic storage.

What could be improved:
1. Code could have additional comments explaining complex logic and function purposes.
2. List<Product> should be replaced with a persistent database.
3. Risk of NullPointerException in the deleteProduct() method could be eliminated with illegal argument exception (adding a check before accessing productId).

My code also follows security practices.
1. To prevent injection attacks, I used Thymeleaf (th: attributes) to prevent Cross-Site Scripting.
2. Product class uses private fields with getters and setters from Lombok for encapsulation and data hiding.
3. I also used UUIDs.

Reflection 2
1. - Not gonna lie, I feel numb :) AHAHAHAHA pls I'm just kidding.
- I think that there isn't a specific number of unit tests that should be made, however we have to make sure that all possible scenarios are tested.
- Test them on various cases (edge cases, mock dependencies, measure code coverage, etc.)
- No, it just means that the entire code has been tested.

2. - The chances of both test suites having similar setup methods are high, hence the code might be redundant. To avoid this, we can gather the common setup logic into a base test class and both test suites can inherit from it.
- However if each test suite has its own implementation, code reusability would be reduced. To avoid this we can use helper methods.
- If a different validation rule is introduced, multiple test suites must be updated separately. We can use parameterized tests/reusable test utilites to keep the test logic modular.
